# 👋 Hi, I'm Trusten Lehmann-Karp

📍 Engineering @ Harvey Mudd College, B.S. Engineering (Computer / EE), Minor in Economics  
⚡ Applied AI + Full-Stack Developer | Building ML infrastructure & products  

---

## 🚀 What I Build
I focus on **applied AI systems, LLM tooling, and full-stack applications** — blending model development, data pipelines, and user-facing products.

- **[Thrust](https://github.com/trusten5/ai-RAG-pdf-knowledgebase)** – AI knowledge base for consultants  
  → Summarization, semantic memory (pgvector), retrieval-augmented LLM assistants  
  → Tech: FastAPI, Next.js, Supabase, OpenAI APIs  

- **[Persisto](https://github.com/trusten5/persisto-smaas-python-sdk)** – Semantic memory-as-a-service  
  → Python SDK + FastAPI backend with pgvector; save/query/delete embeddings at scale  
  → Focus: developer-first APIs, usage logging, and retry logic  

- **xG Model** – Expected Value model for soccer data analytics  
  → End-to-end ML pipeline to engineer spatial features, train logistic regression models, and generate dynamic heatmap visualizations for data insights 
  → Python, scikit-learn, matplotlib  

- **Equity Prediction Pipeline** – Time-series ML + backtesting  
  → Engineered 20+ macro features; trained LR, RF, XGBoost with time-aware CV  
  → Backtested S&P 500 subsets; achieved Sharpe > 1 on select horizons
